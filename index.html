                                            false. Statements do not necessarily have a right or wrong answer. But they
                                            are straightforward statements which are easy to understand. An example
                                            statement would be something like "The Sky is blue." This task can be
                                            completed on your own smartphone or touchscreen device. We also encourage
                                            you to not overthink any of the answers and invite you to compete with other
                                            participants to try and achieve the quickest time. Upon completing all of

                                            should help our understanding of the theories of Plato's forms. This, in
                                            turn, is expected to be beneficial to the class in understanding Plato's
